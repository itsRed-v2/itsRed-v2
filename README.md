# Hi there 👋

I'm a nerd and I love **mathematics** (like really), physics and of course programming and computer science.

## What I do

A considerable amount of my lifetime was spent on Minecraft, and therefore
- 🔩 I know a lot about the technical aspect of the game (which is fascinating) and I can make creations with command blocks, datapacks, resource packs, and redstone. Ask me if you think I can help on these topics !
- 🔌 I made many plugins for spigot/paper, and I'm now trying to make a fabric clientside mod.

However I didn't only do Minecraft-related projects, I also made a **discord bot** 🤖, a **web tool** 🔧, and many more fun projects.

I also sometimes play on [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/) 🧩 (Here is [my profile](https://www.codingame.com/profile/ace136d450d023344c8451605faaec018445904)) and I do [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) 🎄 every year.

If you want to know more about my projects, or need help about anything related (or not) to the topics above, don't hesitate to ask me !

## What I know

I have some experience in
- ☕️ java,
- 🟨 javascript,
- 🐍 python,
- ⚙️ C,
- 🖥️ and the web things: HTML and CSS.

I've also done a tiny bit of C# for unity.

## How I learned

Most of the things I know, I learned on Youtube 📺 or on the Internet. I'm **always willing to learn something new**.  
When it comes to coding 💻, I'm almost completely self-taught, thanks to all the resources online.  
I especially love learning about **math** 🔢 and computer science (not just programming).

And I'm **french** 🇫🇷 🥖
