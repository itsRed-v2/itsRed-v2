### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

***

I like to code.

I know:
- Java
- Javascript
- Python
- HTML & CSS

and I'm currently learning C.

***

I make some plugins for minecraft **spigot** and **paper**, but I also have tons of other projects.

I play minecraft a lot, and I can make cool things with **command blocks**, **datapacks** and **resource packs**.

I make projects just for myself, but i also work on **ElementaryLand**: https://discord.gg/7KFdWef

***

And I'm **FRENCH** ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· ðŸ¥–
