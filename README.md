### Hi there 👋

***

I like to code.

I know:
- Java
- Javascript
- Python
- HTML & CSS

and I'm currently learning C.

***

I make some plugins for minecraft **spigot** and **paper**, but I also have tons of other projects.

I play a lot of minecraft, and I can make cool things with **command blocks**, **datapacks** and **resource packs**.

I make projects just for myself, but i also work on
- **Nosto**: https://discord.io/Nosto
  - As a **plugin developer** 💻 mainly, but also as a **builder** 🏗️

***

And I'm **FRENCH** 🇫🇷 🥖
